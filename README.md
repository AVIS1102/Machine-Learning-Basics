# Machine-Learning-Basics

@ This repository is useed to learn basics of machine learning 
     It is based on  simple model with sklearn library 
     
 # Preprocesssing data
  Data cleaning and prepprocessing  is the most significiant task for every data scientist to do here the dataset are as simple as possible and its the basics to get into the real world dataset.
